CSS3 Valentines Card
=================
A fancy Valentines Day Card, made almost entirely with CSS3 (JS is needed to read the url hash). [Roots](http://roots.cx) was used to manage all compiling.

Use the link `http://slang800.github.com/valentines-card/#"<to>","<from>"` to go to the card. Edit the url's hash to change the name (replacing `<to>` and `<from>`). this has only been tested in Chrome and is known to be broken in Firefox
