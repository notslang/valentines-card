CSS3 Valentines Card
=================
A fancy Valentines Day Card, made almost entirely with CSS3... JS is needed to read the url hash

use the link `http://slang800.github.com/valentines-card/#"<to>","<from>"` to go to the car. edit the url's hash to change the name (replacing `<to>` and `<from>`). this has only been tested in chrome and is known to be broken in Firefox
